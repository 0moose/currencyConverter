# Currency Converter and Future Price Predictor

This repository contains a currency converter web application implemented in JavaScript. It allows users to convert amounts between different currencies based on predefined conversion rates. Additionally, the codebase has the potential to be extended into a future price predictor.

## Currency Conversion

The currency conversion functionality of the application is implemented using JavaScript. It leverages a JSON dataset of conversion rates between various currencies, allowing users to input an amount in a selected currency and convert it to another currency. The conversion rates are fetched from the dataset and applied to calculate the converted amount.



## Future Price Prediction

The codebase has the potential to be extended into a future price predictor. By incorporating additional data sources, such as historical currency exchange rates or other relevant factors, the application can be enhanced to predict future currency exchange rates. This could be useful for individuals or businesses involved in foreign exchange trading or international finance.

Please note that the current implementation of the application does not include the future price prediction feature. However, the codebase serves as a foundation that can be built upon to add this functionality in the future.
